But I shouldn't talk because when people on quora disagree with me they always comment about my shitty spelling. But I to think Biden is not doing a good job. Everything is going up in price, crime is out of control, we have open borders so whoever wants to come here nows the time. No vetting no background checks if you're looking for work or if you have a long criminal history or even a terrorist you're welcome on the Biden Harris open borders policy. One more thing can you believe that since the crime is getting so out of control especially in the democratic run inner cities they are blaming the Republicans for defunding the police. Was I asleep last year because I thought that was the democrats theme line during the George Floyd riots. AOC in the front of the defund the police line. You got to give them this they say that with a straight face."

But the only reason Obama did not appoint one is because he couldn't, not because he felt it was wrong to do so. In fact, the Democrats argued that it was the constitutional duty of the Senate to confirm a new appointment regardless of the impending election. They even filed a (failed due to a technicality) federal lawsuit to force the Senate hearing. The only reason Obama did not appoint a new justice was because the Republicans had control of the Senate and blocked him from doing so. Democrats absolutely would have appointed a new justice if they had had the means, they did not refrain from doing so out of some notion that the people should have some indirect say in a new appointment.  Democrats that now say the Senate should not confirm a new appointment during an election year is guilty of the same hypocrisy as the Republicans. The two parties have simply changed rhetoric because that's what poloticians do.  I recognize that there may be some sort of angle that I'm not seeing here and would welcome any insights."

They are very much against passing anything a Democrat has brought to the discussion, but then will discuss in detail how Democrats are dividing this country and creating an increasing partisan interest. They have significantly criticized Biden for dividing the two sides when in fact he has been fairly moderate as a President and has been taking Republican views into account and genuinely trying to compromise. This is unlike Trump who spent so much of his speaking platform discussing the difference between Republicans and Democrats and how Republicans are doing everything right and Democrats are just troublemakers."

I think political leaders in both parties are both frequently hypocritical, but I suppose some examples from Republicans are more salient to me, particularly pertaining to bodily autonomy, abortion, healthcare, and access to adoption/social services. If one wants to promote not getting abortions, I would think they would simultaneously support increasing social support and economic incentives that would afford more opportunities to raise said children."

I think looking at the situation with Russia and Ukraine is a good example. Under the Trump administration and since then a number of Republicans have been big backers of Russia/Putin. And now some of those same people are trying to blame this situation on Democrats and saying they weren't/aren't tough enough on Russia."
