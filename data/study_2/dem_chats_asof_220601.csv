I think it makes for a better country to allow people to express themselves without being too quick to jump to conclusions. If I were to consider both sides and had to choose one, it is tempting to select Republicans as more hypocritical.

It was refused. Sometimes I cannot help but wonder where that behavior stems from. Is it because  they are hypocritical with their behaviors toward gun laws? I don't know if that's so easy to conclude."

It is so gut wrenching to read about these shootings happening in clusters while politicians seem to be unable to come to a conclusion that we need better mental health care access. Yes, it may involve changes to the gun laws as well which means adjusting our sense of individual freedom versus collective freedom as a country. My heart goes out to everyone dealing with these feelings of dread and fear. I find it a bit hypocritical that they blame the shooter as being mentally ill but then refused a bill in that state which would have improved access to people who are struggling with anger and isolation."

It simply stands out recently that conservatives, some of them of course not all, chose to behave in a way that blocked people access to the help they desperately need so these events may not occur AS often as they are currently. We're the one nation with the highest amount of mass shootings if I understand right."

With the most current events - I mean senseless, evil shootings - I would say that the Republicans are even more hypocritical than usual. The narrative ""A good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun"" obviously isn't true/adequate for public safety. I heard interviews with gunowners in Texas on NPR this morning, and their justifications for keeping the laws as they are - or expanding gun ownership - were NOT logical! Hypocritical. "

I feel that Democrats have been talking about doing something about gun control for such a long time now, and after events like this, they come out full-force saying something needs to be done, but then nothing comes of it.

I believe that Democrats are more hypocritical than Republicans, for sure, because they promise to make the lives of everyday people better through economic improvement and socialized programs, but don't say that it will result in higher taxes and costs of goods. Republicans, I feel, aren't ashamed of their wealth and don't flip-flop on conservative stances on hot-button issues so much. How do you feel?"

Joe Biden, during his State of the Union Address in 2022, talked about adding jobs and providing financial security for hard-working Americans. As we see, however, he's failed to keep the price of gasoline and everyday, necessary goods under control, and people are struggling all over. I mean, the inflation rate spiked to 8.5%-12% recently, while it's normally only about 1.5%-2%. This doesn't feel like economic prosperity to me."

Although I'm a Democrat, I hate to say it, but Democrats make huge promises that they know that can't keep, but just provide lip service to get votes."

They may make more money in the process though but also might make a moral mistake and then not blame themselves because of the money they would get. Democrats on the basis of being a Deomocrat is to stay more in tune with the way the government is run fairly for everyone. So based on that I think the Republicans would be the ones to be just maybe slightly a little more hypocritcal and that be about the only small way they would be."

They think that poor people don't deserve any type of breaks. Look at what Donald Trump did  he gave $600 extra a week on top of their unemployement.  The way I see it the rich got richer because now they don't want to go to work.  That leaves the seniors and low income people who were on welfare with very little even though how the prices went up they did  not get any increase.  Think about it $600 a week times 4 weeks is an extra $2400 a month on top of unemployment.  Some didn't even make that much in a week."

The Republican politicians 'claim' to care about the American people, about the little man, about Educating our children, about protecting our children, about providing healthcare to Americans, but, nothing that they do is a reflection of any of these values.  They claim that they care about our Democracy, but, then do nothing to hold the people, politicians, and particularly trump, for supporting an attempt to 'overthrow' our Democracy.  Something that I NEVER thought that I would see happen in this country.  We have seen governments overthrown in 3rd world countries for many, many years; but, it just seemed like something that was impossible in our Democracy.  I am truly ashamed to have these people represent us in Washington, and for whatever reason, they are to justify their disgusting behavior.  I believer it is solely their greed and their desire to retain their seats that is more important than anything."

I have asked them how much they were willing to pay in extra taxes to fund the development of these children but none of them ever answer."

I can't imagine why these weapons are even allowed to exist in the hands of people who are not actively fighting a war on the ground. Send them all to the Ukraine so they will have an easier time of it."

I guess they'll find a way to criminalize women who aren't able to find suitable adoptive homes for the babies they were forced to have. "

I say send the owners along with the weapons if they want to play war so badly. "

They will send people to die needlessly in a war of aggression, but still want to hold onto the mantle of being 'pro-life.'"

And next will be the remaining civil liberties that we currently have. It will be illegal for gay people to marry, illegal for people of color to marry white people. They are going after books now too and that makes me angry. We already have a big problem in this country with people not being educated at all."
